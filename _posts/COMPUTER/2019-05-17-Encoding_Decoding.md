> Encoding_Decoding

* In computers, encoding is the process of **putting a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, and certain symbols) into a specialized format for efficient transmission or storage**. 

* Decoding is the opposite process -- the conversion of an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters. 

* Encoding and decoding are used in data communications, networking, and storage. The term is especially applicable to radio (wireless) communications systems.

* The code used by most computers for text files is known as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange, pronounced ASK-ee). ASCII can depict uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numerals, punctuation marks, and common symbols. Other commonly-used codes include Unicode, BinHex, Uuencode, and MIME. 

* In data communications, Manchester encoding is a special form of encoding in which the binary digits (bits) represent the transitions between high and low logic states. 

* The terms encoding and decoding are often used in reference to the processes of analog-to-digital conversion and digital-to-analog conversion. In this sense, these terms can apply to any form of data, including text, images, audio, video, multimedia, computer programs, or signals in sensors, telemetry, and control systems. 

* Encoding should not be confused with **encryption, a process in which data is deliberately altered so as to conceal its content**. 

# Encryption can be done without changing the particular code that the content is in, and encoding can be done without deliberately concealing the content.
