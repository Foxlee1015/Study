> # NTP

* What is NTP?
  * NTP stands for Network Time Protocol, and it is an Internet protocol used to **synchronize the clocks of computers** to some time reference. 
  * NTP is an Internet standard protocol originally developed by Professor David L. Mills at the University of Delaware.
  
* The Importance of Synchronized Network Time
  * Distributed computer systems rely on coordinated time to guarantee correct sequencing of processes and accurate logging of events. 
  * Time is the only reference that can be used to coordinate processes of independent systems.
  * In many jurisdictions, for certain applications, it is a legal requirement to accurately synchronize computer systems. 
  * For instance, legislation requires that the business clocks of financial trading systems are synchronized very tightly. 
  * For operational and often legal reasons, coordinating the time of modern computer systems is of critical importance.


> NTP Daemon
* The NTPD program is an operating-system daemon that sets and maintains a computer system's system time in synchronization with Internet-standard time servers.
