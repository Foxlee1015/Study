> Ethernet

* Ethernet is the traditional technology for connecting **wired local area networks (LANs)**, enabling devices to communicate with each other via a protocol -- a set of rules or common network language.

* As a data-link layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, Ethernet describes how network devices can format and transmit data packets so other devices on the same local or campus area network segment can recognize, receive and process them. 
  * An Ethernet cable is the physical, encased wiring over which the data travels.

* Any device accessing a geographically localized network using a cable -- i.e., with a wired rather than wireless connection -- likely uses Ethernet -- whether in **a home, school or office setting**. From businesses to gamers, diverse end users depend on the benefits of **Ethernet connectivity, including reliability and security**.

* Compared to wireless LAN technology, Ethernet is typically less vulnerable to disruptions -- whether from radio wave interference, physical barriers or bandwidth hogs. It can also offer a greater degree of network security and control than wireless technology, as devices must connect using physical cabling -- making it difficult for outsiders to access network data or hijack bandwidth for unsanctioned devices.

* ( Bandwidth hog is a slang term for Internet users who use substantially more bandwidth than other users on the same network. Simply put, bandwidth hogs **generally download more content** than other users. 
* ( Hijacking is a type of network security attack in which the attacker takes control of a communication )
* ( Bandwidth is **the capacity of a wired or wireless network communications link to transmit the maximum amount of data** from one point to another over a computer network or internet connection in a given amount of time -- usually one second. Synonymous with capacity, bandwidth describes the data transfer rate. Bandwidth is not ~~a measure of network speed~~ -- a common misconception.)

# Mac address

* A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is **a unique identifier** assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). For communications within a network segment, it is used as **a network address** for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer. As typically represented, MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or no separator.

* Broadcast : It sends a message to all of Pcs in the same Network. the message says 'if Pc Z in this nextwork, give me the MAC address because I'd like to communicate. Once you get the Mac address of Pc Z, you can communicate with it
