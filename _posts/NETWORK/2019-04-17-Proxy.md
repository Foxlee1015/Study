> What’s a Proxy Server?  [link]

* A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. 
* It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse. 
* Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy.
* If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. 
* The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.
