- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language for marking the normal text so that it gets converted into hypertext. 
- Again, not so clear. Basically, HTML tags (e.g. “<head>”, “<body>” etc.) are used to tag or mark normal text so that it becomes hypertext and several hypertext pages can be interlinked with each other resulting in the Web. 
-Please note that the HTML tags are used to help render web pages as well in the Browser.

- On the contrary, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring the hypertext pages from Web Server to Web Browser.
- For exchanging web pages between Server and Browser, an HTTP session is setup using protocol methods (e.g. GET, POST etc.).
