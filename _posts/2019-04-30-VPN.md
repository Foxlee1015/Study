> What Is a VPN?

* VPN stands for Virtual Private Network.
* A virtual private network offers a higher degree of protection and privacy as you’re surfing the web, whether at home or outside.

* Simply put, a VPN creates a **secure connection over public networks** (such as the wi-fi in public transport, hotels, or your favorite café) as well as home networks (like the one provided by your internet service).

* By routing your traffic through specialized servers and encrypting your data, VPNs hide your online activity and protect you from the many dangers on the web – from hacker attacks to data selling, identity theft, and much more.
