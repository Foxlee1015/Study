* Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing **an encrypted link between a server and a client—typically a web server (website)** and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook).
* SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely.
* Normally, data sent between browsers and web servers is sent in plain text—leaving you vulnerable to eavesdropping. 
* If an attacker is able to intercept all data being sent between a browser and a web server, they can see and use that information.

* More specifically, SSL is a security protocol. Protocols describe how algorithms should be used. 
* In this case, the SSL protocol determines variables of the encryption for both the link and the data being transmitted.

* All browsers have the capability to interact with secured web servers using the SSL protocol. 
* However, the browser and the server need what is called an SSL Certificate to be able to establish a secure connection.

* SSL secures millions of peoples’ data on the Internet every day, especially during online transactions or when transmitting confidential information. 
* Internet users have come to associate their online security with the lock icon that comes with an SSL-secured website or green address bar that comes with an Extended Validation SSL-secured website. 
* SSL-secured websites also begin with https rather than http.

* SSL certificates have a key pair: a public and a private key. 
* These keys work together to establish an encrypted connection. 
* The certificate also contains what is called the **“subject”**. which is the **identity of the certificate/website owner**.

* To get a certificate, you must 1. create a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** on your server. 
* This process creates 2. a private key and public key on your server. 
* The CSR data file that you send to the SSL Certificate issuer (called a Certificate Authority or CA) contains the public key. 
* The CA uses the CSR data file to 3. create a data structure to match your private key without compromising the key itself. 
* The CA never sees the private key.

* Once you receive the SSL certificate, you install it on your server.
* You also install an intermediate certificate that establishes the credibility of your SSL Certificate by tying it to your CA’s root certificate. 
* The instructions for installing and testing your certificate will be different depending on your server.
