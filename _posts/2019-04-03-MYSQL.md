MYSQL

MySQL is an open source **relational database management system (RDBMS)**. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for **Structured Query Language.**

*Query language* is primarily created for creating, accessing and modifying data in and out from a database management system (DBMS). Typically, **QL requires users to input a structured command** that is similar and close to the English language querying construct.
For example, the SQL query: SELECT * FROM

*Database(db)*
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.

MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack (and others), which is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python. MySQL is used by many database-driven web applications, including Drupal, Joomla, phpBB, and WordPress. MySQL is also used by many popular websites, including Google (though not for searches), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube.
