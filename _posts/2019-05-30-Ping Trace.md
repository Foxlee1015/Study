> # Ping 

* Ping is a basic Internet program that **allows a user to verify that a particular IP address exists and can accept requests**.

* Ping is used diagnostically to **ensure** that a host computer the user is trying to reach is **actually operating**. 
* Ping works by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request to a specified interface on the network and waiting for a reply. 
* Ping can be used for troubleshooting to test connectivity and determine response time.
